# Vulnerability Management Policy (Final)

## 1. Purpose  
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized and repeatable process for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities within the organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure. This ensures a reduced attack surface and demonstrates alignment with industry-recognized cybersecurity practices.

## 2. Scope  
This policy applies to all server assets managed by the Infrastructure Team, including:
- Azure-hosted virtual machines
- Internal Windows/Linux servers
- Any additional systems included in approved scan scopes

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities  

| Role                | Responsibility                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Team**   | Configure/execute scans, triage findings, coordinate with remediation teams     |
| **Infrastructure**  | Provide scan credentials, perform remediations, validate fixes                  |
| **Risk Team**       | Review findings, prioritize based on business impact, track SLA adherence       |
| **CAB**             | Approve any changes resulting from remediations (e.g., protocol disablement)    |

## 4. Vulnerability Scanning Guidelines  
- **Tool:** Tenable (authenticated scans)  
- **Frequency:** Weekly (pilot phase); Monthly (ongoing)  
- **Scan Engine:** Internal VM (resides in same virtual network as targets)  
- **Credential Access:** JIT Active Directory accounts (disabled outside of scan windows)  
- **Scan Types:**  
  - Authenticated scans  
  - Discovery scans (optional during asset onboarding)  

## 5. Remediation SLAs  

| Severity | Remediation Deadline      | Notes                                         |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Critical | Within 7 business days    | Adjusted based on stakeholder feedback        |
| High     | Within 7 business days    |                                               |
| Medium   | Within 15 business days   |                                               |
| Low      | During standard patching  | Typically covered in monthly maintenance      |

## 6. Exceptions  
Any deviations from the above SLAs must be approved by the Risk Team and documented in the exception register. CAB must be notified for remediations involving system-wide changes.

## 7. Reporting & Communication  
- All findings will be logged in a centralized vulnerability dashboard  
- SLA status will be reviewed bi-weekly in the Security & Infra sync  
- Summary reports will be shared monthly with leadership  

## 8. Policy Maintenance  
This policy will be reviewed quarterly or after major incidents, architecture changes, or tool migrations.
